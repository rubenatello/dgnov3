# 🎉 DGNO Project - Ready to Build!

## ✅ Status: Firebase Connected & Ready!

Your DGNO project is **completely set up** with Firebase connected and working!

### What's Live
- ✅ Dev server at **localhost:5173**
- ✅ Firebase SDK connected to your project
- ✅ Custom color scheme applied
- ✅ Production build successful
- ✅ Security rules prepared

## � Firebase Configuration

**Your Firebase is connected!** The keys in `firebase.ts` are public configuration values (safe to expose). Your real security comes from Firestore rules.

## 📖 Read These Docs

I created comprehensive guides:

1. **QUICKSTART.md** - Get Firebase config in 5 minutes
2. **SETUP.md** - Complete setup and usage guide
3. **BUILD_SUMMARY.md** - Everything that was built
4. **CHECKLIST.md** - Track your development progress
5. **TODO.md** - What to build next (with security reminders!)

## 🎯 Recommendation: Tiptap > CKEditor

I implemented **Tiptap** (not CKEditor) because:
- ✅ Lighter and faster
- ✅ Better React integration
- ✅ Headless (full UI control)
- ✅ Free and open source
- ✅ More modern and extensible

CKEditor is powerful but heavier and has licensing considerations for commercial use.

## 🎨 Your Color Scheme (Live!)

Check localhost:5173 to see your exact colors in action:
- bg: #FCFCFC
- ink: #1D212B  
- accent: #FF9C6E
- paper: #FFFAF0
- stone: #E5E2DC
- sand: #AEA492

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Add Firebase config** (2 minutes)
2. **Test the editor**: Change `HomePage` to `ArticleEditorPage` in App.tsx
3. **Install React Router** for navigation
4. **Build login page**
5. **Create article list**
